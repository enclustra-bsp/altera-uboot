config DM_SPI_FLASH
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPI flash"
	depends on DM && DM_SPI
	help
	  Enable driver model for SPI flash. This SPI flash interface
	  (spi_flash_probe(), spi_flash_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI flash uclass. There is one standard
	  SPI flash driver which knows how to probe most chips
	  supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_flash.h, but is currently fully compatible
	  with the old interface to avoid confusion and duplication
	  during the transition parent. SPI and SPI flash must be
	  enabled together (it is not possible to use driver model
	  for one and not the other).

config SPI_FLASH_SANDBOX
	bool "Support sandbox SPI flash device"
	depends on SANDBOX && DM_SPI_FLASH
	help
	  Since sandbox cannot access real devices, an emulation mechanism is
	  provided instead. Drivers can be connected up to the sandbox SPI
	  bus (see CONFIG_SANDBOX_SPI) and SPI traffic will be routed to this
	  device. Typically the contents of the emulated SPI flash device is
	  stored in a file on the host filesystem.
